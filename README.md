“I will be the winner”
Not everyone is able to reach dizzying heights. Not everyone gets everything that they desire. And yet, everyone can be a winner. Winning is an attitude and becomes a habit with time. The relentless pursuit of happiness, success and the willingness to work hard are the hallmarks of a winning attitude. There is a winner in each one of us, only a few are able to exploit this attitude in their lives.
